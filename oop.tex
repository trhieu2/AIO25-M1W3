			\caption{When to Use Inheritance vs Delegation}
			\label{tab:inheritance-delegation}
			\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{>{\bfseries}l X X}
				\toprule
				Scenario & Prefer Inheritance & Prefer Delegation (Composition) \\
				\midrule
				Relationship &
				Clear “is-a” (\texttt{Dog} is-a \texttt{Animal}) &
				“has-a” or “uses-a” (\texttt{Car} has-a \texttt{Engine}) \\
				Behavior Extension &
				You need to override or extend base behavior directly &
				You want to assemble behavior from multiple, independent components \\
				Runtime Flexibility &
				Static relationships known at design time &
				Ability to swap in different implementations at runtime \\
				Coupling Concerns &
				Acceptable tight coupling to parent &
				You need loose coupling and easier testing via mocks \\
				Hierarchy Complexity &
				Simple, shallow hierarchies &
				Avoids deep, fragile inheritance trees \\
				Single Responsibility &
				Parent and child share cohesive domain &
				Each class focuses on its own concern \\
